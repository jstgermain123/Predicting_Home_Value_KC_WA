# Predicting Home Value in King County, Washington
ALY_6040 Group Project created to showcase data cleanup, modeling, and optimization.
The goal of our analysis was to create an optimized model to help predict home prices in King County, Washington. 
To do this, we created several models that included feature engineering techniques, backward and forward feature selection, and a random forest model. 
Prior to modeling, data cleaning techniques were employed, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed. 
After the completion of EDA, an initial multiple linear regression model was created using all variables in the dataset. 
The results of this model were used as a benchmark for each optimized model we created. 
Once each optimized model was created, we recorded key information about their accuracy and speed to aid us in the comparison between models. 
After all data was compiled, a determination was made as to which model should be utilized by homeowners in King County.
